# Team_Profile_Generator (WIP - UNFINISHED AS OF 4/30/2022)
Section 10 (OOP) assignment/challenge. We have been asked to build a Node.js CL application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. This will also require that we utilize tests to ensure our code is working and maintaibable.

Currently unfinished, finished with classes and main index.js, but still need to write tests and code the dynamic HTML elements. Then finalize README and video.
